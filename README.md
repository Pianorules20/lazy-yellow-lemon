# Lazy Yellow Lemon

## A nice yellow color theme for VSCode

I wanted a nice yellow theme for vscode. I couldn't find one that was decent.

Yellow themes to me are nicer than plain white themes. Dark can be hard to see on a shitty monitor
and I generally prefer lighter things in general. The yellow makes it slightly easier on the eyes.

**Enjoy!**
